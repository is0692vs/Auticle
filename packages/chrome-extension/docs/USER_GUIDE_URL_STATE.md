# URL State Feature User Guide

## What's New? ðŸŽ‰

Audicle now remembers your on/off settings for each website independently!

### Before This Update:
- Turning ON Audicle affected ALL websites
- No way to have different settings for different sites
- Had to manually toggle every time you visited a new site

### After This Update:
- Each website remembers its own on/off setting
- Set it once per site, and it stays that way
- More convenient and flexible

## How to Use

### Basic Usage

1. **Visit a website** (e.g., example.com)
2. **Click the Audicle extension icon** in your browser toolbar
3. **Toggle the reading mode switch** ON or OFF
4. **Done!** Your setting is saved for example.com

When you return to example.com later, Audicle will remember your setting.

### Example Scenario

Let's say you like to use Audicle on news sites but not on social media:

```
1. Visit news.example.com
   â†’ Turn Audicle ON
   â†’ Reading mode enabled

2. Visit social.example.com  
   â†’ Extension shows OFF (default)
   â†’ Leave it OFF

3. Return to news.example.com
   â†’ Audicle is still ON
   â†’ Reading mode automatically enabled
```

## Understanding URL States

### What Gets Saved?

Audicle saves the on/off state based on the **hostname** (domain name):

| URL | Saved As | Notes |
|-----|----------|-------|
| `https://example.com/page1` | `example.com` | Path ignored |
| `https://example.com/page2` | `example.com` | Same state as page1 |
| `https://github.com/user/repo` | `github.com` | Different from example.com |
| `http://localhost:8080/test` | `localhost` | Local development |

### Key Points:

- âœ… **Per-domain**: All pages on same domain share the setting
- âœ… **Persistent**: Settings survive browser restarts
- âœ… **Independent**: Each domain has its own setting
- âœ… **Automatic**: No manual sync needed

## Managing Your Settings

### View All Saved States

Open Chrome DevTools (F12) and run in Console:

```javascript
chrome.storage.local.get(['urlStates'], (result) => {
  console.log('Your saved states:', result.urlStates);
});
```

Example output:
```javascript
{
  "qiita.com": true,
  "github.com": false,
  "example.com": true
}
```

### Reset a Specific Site

To reset settings for a specific domain:

```javascript
chrome.storage.local.get(['urlStates'], (result) => {
  const urlStates = result.urlStates || {};
  delete urlStates['example.com'];  // Replace with your domain
  chrome.storage.local.set({ urlStates });
  console.log('Reset complete!');
});
```

### Reset All States

To clear all saved settings:

```javascript
chrome.storage.local.set({ urlStates: {} }, () => {
  console.log('All URL states cleared!');
});
```

## Default Behavior

### First Visit to a Site

When you visit a site for the first time (or after clearing data):
- Audicle starts in **OFF** mode by default
- You can turn it ON for that specific site
- Your choice is remembered

### Backward Compatibility

If you were using Audicle before this update:
- Your old global `enabled` setting is used as the default
- New sites will use this setting until you change it
- Your existing behavior is preserved

## Tips & Tricks

### Recommended Setup

For best experience:

1. **News & Articles Sites**: Turn ON
   - Better for long-form reading
   - e.g., news sites, blogs, documentation

2. **Interactive Sites**: Keep OFF
   - Social media, web apps, dashboards
   - Where you click frequently

3. **Testing/Development**: Customize as needed
   - localhost can be ON for testing
   - Production sites based on preference

### Quick Toggle

The fastest way to toggle:
1. Click extension icon (or use keyboard shortcut)
2. Flip the switch
3. Close popup (auto-saves)

No need to click "Save" or "Apply" - changes are instant!

## Troubleshooting

### Setting Not Saving?

If your setting doesn't persist:

1. **Check Chrome storage permissions**
   - Extension should have "storage" permission
   - Check in `chrome://extensions`

2. **Clear and re-set**
   ```javascript
   chrome.storage.local.get(['urlStates'], (result) => {
     console.log('Current states:', result.urlStates);
   });
   ```

3. **Reload the extension**
   - Go to `chrome://extensions`
   - Click the reload icon for Audicle

### Extension Not Activating?

If the extension doesn't activate after turning ON:

1. **Refresh the page** (F5)
   - Settings apply to page loads
   - Current page needs refresh

2. **Check the console**
   - F12 â†’ Console tab
   - Look for any error messages

3. **Verify current state**
   ```javascript
   chrome.storage.local.get(['urlStates'], (result) => {
     const hostname = window.location.hostname;
     console.log(`State for ${hostname}:`, result.urlStates?.[hostname]);
   });
   ```

## Privacy Note

All settings are stored **locally** in your browser:
- Nothing is sent to external servers
- Data stays on your computer
- Cleared when you clear browser data
